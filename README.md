# Haskell
Some operations using haskell functions
slice function-Assume i < j and it can't be equal. Also i>0 always and list contains only integers. 
2. delete function-Assume k>0 always as list index starts from 1.
3. sortlist function-It sorts a list of integers in ascending order according to the length of sublists in list. 
4. flatten function-It transforms a list of integers into a flat list by replacing each sublist with its elements.
